Sure! Let's explain shallow copy and deep copy in a simple way with bullet points and examples:

**Shallow Copy:**
- Shallow copy creates a new object and copies the top-level structure, but it does not duplicate the nested objects.
- The new object contains references to the same nested objects as the original object.

**Example:**
Suppose we have a class `Person` with a nested class `Address`. When we perform a shallow copy of a `Person` object, both the original and copied objects share the same `Address` object.

```java
class Address {
    String city;

    Address(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }
}

class Person {
    String name;
    Address address;

    Person(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }
}

Address address = new Address("New York");
Person person1 = new Person("John", address);

// Perform shallow copy of person1
Person person2 = new Person(person1.name, person1.address);

// Change the city in the copied address
person2.address.city = "San Francisco";

// Both person1 and person2 now have the same address city
System.out.println(person1.address.city); // Output: San Francisco
```

**Deep Copy:**
- Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all the nested objects, creating independent copies of the original object and all its nested objects.
- The new object and its nested objects are completely separate from the original object and its nested objects.

**Example:**
Suppose we have the same classes `Address` and `Person`. When we perform a deep copy of a `Person` object, the new object and all its nested objects are independent of the original object.

```java
class DeepAddress {
    String city;

    DeepAddress(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }
}

class DeepPerson {
    String name;
    DeepAddress address;

    DeepPerson(String name, DeepAddress address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    DeepPerson(DeepPerson original) {
        this.name = original.name;
        this.address = new DeepAddress(original.address.city);
    }
}

DeepAddress address = new DeepAddress("New York");
DeepPerson person1 = new DeepPerson("John", address);

// Perform deep copy of person1
DeepPerson person2 = new DeepPerson(person1);

// Change the city in the copied address
person2.address.city = "San Francisco";

// person1 and person2 have separate address cities
System.out.println(person1.address.city); // Output: New York
System.out.println(person2.address.city); // Output: San Francisco
```

**Summary:**
- Shallow copy creates a new object but shares nested objects with the original object.
- Deep copy creates a new object and duplicates all the nested objects, making them independent of the original object.
